# Jupyter(Lab) tools and extensions
A personal collection of Jupyter tools and extensions. Mostly so I don't forget about them. Descriptions mostly come directly from the tool's github page

- [**jupyterlab-toc**](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-toc) - A Table of Contents extension for JupyterLab. This auto-generates a table of contents in the left area when you have a notebook or markdown document open. The entries are clickable, and scroll the document to the heading in question.
- [**voila**](https://github.com/QuantStack/voila) - HTML Rendering of live Jupyter notebooks with interactive widgets
- [**nb2xls**](https://github.com/ideonate/nb2xls) - Convert Jupyter notebooks to Excel Spreadsheets, through a new 'Download As' option or via nbconvert on the command line
- [**jupyterlab_code_formatter**](https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter) - Code formatter for JupyterLab
- [**google-drive**](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-google-drive) - This extension adds a Google Drive filebrowser to the left sidepanel of JupyterLab. When you are logged into your Google account, you will have the files stored in it available to JupyterLab.
- [**xkcd**](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_xkcd) - Show a random xkcd.com comic in a JupyterLab panel
